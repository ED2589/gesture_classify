## Itâ€™s all in the wrist: classifying reach and grasp motions to improve hand function in young people with cerebral palsy via a personalized therapy video game

*Partial* data preprocessing and machine learning scripts from my 4-month research internship in hand gesture classification using EMG and IMU data from youth participants.  

The goal of this project is to design a reward-based therapeutic video game that integrates hand gesture recognition in real time for youths to practice three hand movements.
